\section{Fully-Deletable FSS}\label{fd-fss}

\subsection{Motivation}

The motivation for Fully-Deletable FSS (FD-FSS) is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Allows to delegate computation of a function $f$ to 2 servers
such that neither server learns any information about $f$.

\item Outputs can be reconstructed publicly (without need to store a
secret key).

\item Additionally, it allows for security against collusion, which
could be a significant issue in the long run. Either of the
2 parties can provide a certificate, which when verified, guarantees
that the servers learn nothing about $f$, even upon collusion.

\item Furthermore, using quantum deletion certificates, the client
can simultaneously perform verification and reconstruct the results
of evaluations.
\end{enumerate}
