\section{Distributed Copy Protection}\label{sec:dcp}

In this section, we will explore the related notion of copy
protection, but under a somewhat different setting than that of DSL.
We will be considering a notion similar to that of unclonable
secret-sharing \cite{}. Specifically, a function $f$ is split among
two servers such that the servers may obtain additive shares of the
evaluations of the software. Since the notion of copy-protection
does not have a notion of revocation, we will not be able to
guarantee security against collusion. However, can we prevent each
party from locally copying its share to a third-party such that
the third-party can perform evaluations. For motivation, imagine a
scenario where the two parties will not collude with each other for
fear of being reprimanded but may sell to a third party who buys
from both. Can we protect against arbitrary unlearnable functions in
this setting?
