\section{Delete-before-Observe FSS}\label{sec:dbo-fss}

\subsection{Motivation}

The motivation for Delete-before-Observe FSS (DbO-FSS) is as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A client can delegate a function $f$ among two servers such
that neither server learns anything about $f$. Importantly, the
servers can obtain additive shares of function evaluations.

\item Additivity ensures that reconstruction is efficient in terms
of communication and computation.

\item Additivity allows for share compression, which is especially
useful if multiple parties need to delegate their own policies
(functions), and the servers need to compute on the outputs.

\item The servers can keep performing computation and reconstruct
only at some point in the future to publicly reveal some outputs.

\item Before the outputs are reconstructed, a client can request its
function shares to be deleted if it is suspicious of collusion.
\end{enumerate}
