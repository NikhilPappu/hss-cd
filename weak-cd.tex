\section{FSS-wCD with Additive Reconstruction}\label{sec:hss-cd}

Next, we will consider the related notion of function secret-sharing
(FSS) with weak certified-deletion. Intuitively, this allows a
function $f$ from some function family $\calF$ to be shared among
the parties. The parties can then evaluate $f$ in a distributed
fashion. Intuitively, after deletion, they can obtain the outcomes
of the evaluations but should learn no other information.

How to formalize this? For starters, lets just stick to PRFs.
